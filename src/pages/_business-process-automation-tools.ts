    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why Small Businesses Need Automation Tools</h2>
    <ul class="list-none space-y-6 text-gray-600">
      <li>
        <strong>Time Savings:</strong> Automating routine processes allows your team to complete tasks faster than manual methods. Activities like sending follow-up emails or updating records can be done automatically, freeing up hours each week. <br>
        <em>Research Reference:</em> "Automation can save small businesses significant time, allowing them to focus on growth."

      <li>
        <strong>Reducing Errors:</strong> Manual data entry and repetitive steps are prone to human mistakes. Automated systems execute processes consistently, dramatically reducing errors in invoices, customer data, or stock levels.<br>
        <em>Research Reference:</em> "Automation reduces manual errors, leading to more reliable outcomes."
