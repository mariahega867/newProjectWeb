    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">What is Customer Segmentation?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      <a href="https://www.netguru.com/blog/ai-business-applications" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Customer segmentation with machine learning</a> divides your customer base into distinct groups based on buying habits, demographics, and more. This empowers precise marketing, personalized offers, and higher satisfaction. Unlike manual approaches, ML enables deeper insights by uncovering complex patterns beyond obvious traits.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">How Machine Learning Improves Segmentation</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Traditional segmentation relies on manual analysis and limited variables, often missing nuances. Machine learning algorithms like K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering automatically discover segments in large, multifaceted datasets, revealing relationships and actionable personas. ML-driven segmentation results in higher marketing ROI and smarter resource allocation. <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/machine-learning-and-generative-ai-what-are-they-good-for" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">Research</a> confirms ML’s ability to analyze at scale, far surpassing manual methods.
