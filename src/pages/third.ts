    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">What Is Business Process Automation?</h3>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      Business process automation (<a href="https://techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/business-process-automation" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">BPA</a>) uses technology to perform repetitive, rule-based tasks automatically, minimizing human effort. For small businesses, BPA software targets tasks like invoicing, data entry, and customer updates to streamline operations and reduce errors.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      BPA works by identifying tasks that happen repeatedly. It then creates workflows that software robots or systems execute automatically, freeing staff to focus on strategic activities. For example, automating invoicing ensures payments are received on time without manual follow-ups.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-600 mb-6">
      According to <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/business-process-automation" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">TechTarget</a>, BPA leverages systems to automate processes with minimal human intervention, helping small businesses operate more efficiently. Many are adopting affordable, scalable BPA tools because they’re quick to implement and grow with the business.
